# Goal-App-Back

#### Application

###### Tracking your goals is the key to success.

This is my second project at GA. This application was broken into two parts: `Goal-App-Front` & `Goal-App-Back`. The `Goal-App-Back` API was designed to allow a user to `Create, Read, Update and Delete` a goal that will be saved to a Mongo database.

#### Important Links

`Goal-App-Back` API is deployed here: https://track-a-goal-app.herokuapp.com/

`Goal-App-Front` is the **_Frontend_** for this application, the repo and deployed links can be found here:

- **Repo**: https://github.com/kevinjmosley93/Goal-App-Front

- **Deployed**: https://kevinjmosley93.github.io/Goal-App-Front

#### Planning Story

I started by creating the ERD & Wireframes for the project. I then created the **_Backend_** of the application before moving to the **_Frontend_** to confirm my API routes were working. Lastly, I deployed both parts of the application and added styling.

#### User Stories

- User is able to sign up for an account with email and password.
- User can login and create a goal
- User can view all of their goals
- User can update goals that are completed
- User can delete goals.

#### Technologies Used

- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

#### Wireframe & ERD

#### Unsolved Problems

- Would like for Users to be able to add a motivational image to their goals.
